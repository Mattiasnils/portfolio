        <p>
          I'm going to start off by paraphrasing a quote I read a long time ago.
          It went something like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Social media is the informational equivalent of junk food. It tastes
          good in the moment, but as soon as you finish a two-hour binge, you
          never feel good about yourself. A book, on the other hand, is like a
          well-balanced meal, providing nourishment for the mind and leaving you
          with a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I've always enjoyed reading, and this year I've been able to read six
          phenomenal books on the topics of design and self-development. I
          generally gravitate towards non-fiction books and I have really picked
          up speed towards the end of the year. Here's the full list in the
          order of reading:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Atomic Design (Brad Frost)</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Building Design Systems (Sarrah Vesselov & Taurie Davis)</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Design Systems Handbook (Marco Suarez et al.)</p></li>
          <li><p>Atomic Habits (James Clear)</p></li>
          <li><p>Deep Work (Cal Newport)</p></li>
          <li><p>Can't Hurt Me (David Goggins)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I read the first three books whilst researching for my master's thesis
          on the topic of <strong><em>designing design systems</em></strong> and
          I highly recommend reading them for anyone interested in learning how
          to approach and maintain design decisions at scale. This is something
          I am personally passionate about and believe is wildly important, but
          unfortunately it was completely neglected in my formal education. I'd
          urge all designers to familiarize with the topic as I'm starting to
          see an increasing amount of job descriptions listing it as a desirable
          competence. <br /><br />

          To summarize, a design system is a collection of design guidelines,
          components, and tools that help teams to create consistent and
          coherent user experiences. They provide a shared vocabulary and set of
          standards for discussing, designing and building products across an
          organization. This helps to streamline the development process,
          improve the usability of the products, and ensure that the products
          are visually consistent and on-brand. Typically, a design system
          encompasses typography, colors, iconography, and layout guidelines, as
          well as reusable components such as buttons, forms, and navigation
          menus. Finally, design systems often include documentation and code
          that facilitate the hand-off between designers and developers.
          <br /><br />

          Thanks to these books, I've learned how to approach building design
          systems based on best practices combined with user needs and
          organizational context. Through reading papers and practicing the
          craft during my thesis, I've also learned how to utilize different
          tools and methods for prototyping, hosting and managing systems to
          enable efficient contribution and balancing coherence with
          flexibility. I've come to realize that a design system can be seen as
          an interface between different disciplines of an organization. Hence,
          like any interface, the user experience of a design system can be
          thoughtfully designed to maximize utility, efficiency and satisfaction
          for its users. <br /><br />

        <h4>Atomic Habits</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Atomic Habits</em> is a cult classic in the self-development world
          and I've been wanting to read it for a long time. The author
          essentially describes how small changes in your daily habits can lead
          to exponential improvements long term. The book explains the science
          behind habit formation and provides tips for building good habits and
          breaking bad ones. In essence, we get more out of small repeated
          actions than going all-in on something for a short time. This is true
          for work, exercise, learning a new skill etc. One of my favorite
          insights from the book is the fact that people often think they lack
          motivation to do something, when in reality they lack clarity.
          Planning ahead and deciding where, when and how you are going to
          perform a certain action helps bring clarity and makes motivation much
          less of a factor. <br /><br />

          Moreover, habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Dopamine is
          released not only when we experience pleasure, but also when we
          anticipate it. Ultimately, it is the idea of pleasure that we chase
          and the anticipation of a reward that gets us to take action.
          Following the successful completion of a habit with a reward, hence,
          makes the habit itself more attractive. Lastly, one of the things that
          hit home for me personally, as a maximizer and, to an extent,
          perfectionist was this quote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Motion makes you feel like you're getting things done. But really,
          you're just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes
          a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don't
          want to be merely planning.You want to be practicing.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I often find myself doing extensive preparation and research in search
          for the optimal product, service or best practice before I take any
          action. This is also known as analysis paralysis, and it sadly tends
          to inhibit my ability to execute in many parts of my personal life.
          The key takeaway here is that I have to embrace mistakes and focus
          more on getting things done rather than trying to make them perfect -
          scary but absolutely crucial.
        </p>

        <span class="divider"></span>

        <h4>Deep Work</h4>
        <p>
          This book was simply phenomenal. The basic idea is that the ability to
          focus intensely on demanding tasks is becoming a rarity but also
          increasingly important in today's society. As the average attention
          span drops and productivity deteriorates, the ability to perform deep
          work for extended periods of time will become an invaluable skill that
          distinguishes you from the masses. However, modern businesses are
          seldom set up in a way that promotes deep work: open offices,
          serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication, and an active
          presence on social media. There is a false conception where, in the
          absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and
          valuable in a job, many knowledge workers turn back toward an
          industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible
          manner - business as a proxy for productivity. <br><br>

          The author goes on to describe strategies for blocking out distractions and achieving true depth. For instance, quitting social media and decoupling distraction impulses from action with a 5 min delay gets you far.<br><br>
          
          One of my main takeaways from the book is the fact that it is easier to find meaning and pleasure in work than in free time.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because
          like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and
          challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's
          work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other
          hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped
          into something that can be enjoyed. <br />
          <br />
          - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Newport shares a few rules to help spend more time in a state of depth
          (or flow): Taking breaks from focus instead of taking breaks from
          distraction, dividing the work-day and free time into online and
          offline blocks, and scheduling every minute of the day to encourage
          mindfulness towards how you spend your time. It is not a matter of
          restricting oneself to adhere to the plan perfectly, it's about asking
          oneself "What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?".
        </p>

        <h4>Can't Hurt Me</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Can't Hurt Me</em> is a highly captivating and inspirational
          memoir told by Goggins about his journey from a troubled childhood and
          detrimental lifestyle to becoming a high achieving athlete with a
          successful military career. He describes ways of finding the inner
          strength and resilience to achieve remarkable goals and unlocking your
          maximum potential. <br /><br />

          My main takeaway is that we are capable of so much more than we think.
          Sadly, many of us get comfortable and satisfied, settling for
          mediocracy, and sticking to our safe-zones. We listen to the doubts of
          our inner voices, our governors, who tells us what we are and what we
          are not capable of. We pacify ourselves with excuses; that we weren't
          born to do it etc. but in order to really excel and, as Goggins puts
          it, ”callous our minds”, we have to seek out discomfort. Optimally, we
          should challenge ourselves mentally and physically on a daily basis.
          That is the only way to grow and become a better version of yourself.
          You have to choose the path of most resistance and defy comfort. I
          think the following quote sums it up quite well:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack,
          efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm
          that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There's no
          denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if
          you're lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or
          self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your governor,
          you'll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and
          obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work
          ethic to back them up.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This book completely changed my perspective of the word "impossible"
          and I immediately had to put it into practice. For a long time, I had
          told myself that I did not have it in me to run a 10K. After reading
          the book, I replaced the idea of "Why would I even subject myself to
          the pain and exhaustion of distance running?" with a far more alluring
          question: "What am I capable of?". I proceeded to break through all my
          previous mindset barriers and ran my first ever 12K at a surprisingly
          acceptable pace of 4:58 min/km. What am I capable of? <br /><br />

          And what are <em>you</em> capable of?
