        <p>
          If you've worked with me before, you know I'm a very digital being. 
          I use my phone, computer and tablet for everything: taking notes, reading
           books, control my lights, monitor my sleep, track my runs and even prototype
            different furniture arrangements before moving to a new apartment. 
          <br /><br />

          Digital is great! I can access all of my work and media wherever I go,
          allowing me to live a relatively lean and flexible lifestyle with little attachment 
          to physical possessions. Recently, I was basically able to move from Gothenburg to 
          Stockholm bringing only a carry-on suitcase and a backpack worth of personal belongings.
          However, as my life has become more and more dominated by digital workflows, I realize
          there are still activities and tasks that benefit from being tactile in nature.  
          <br /><br />

          One such activity is collaboration. <br /><br />

          Being in the same room and using physical artifacts to sketch, ideate, prototype and discuss,
          I feel, leads to much better engagement and flow in the team. I love the ability to quickly
          reach out and ask a question, point towards something and, above all, sketch together on a whiteboard.
          <br /><br />

          I think whiteboards, more so than pen and paper, lend themselves perfectly to the iterative 
          process of collaborative design work. The very nature of using erasable markers establishes 
          a crucial  sense of impermanence. Whiteboards are not bound by the rigidity of pixels or the 
          permanence of ink; they invite experimentation, boldness, and the willingness to erase and start
          anew without hesitation.
          <br /><br />

          The sheer size of a whiteboard provides just enough space and freedom for large visualizations
           and creativity, while still confining ideas and conversations to focus on the essential.
          <br /><br />

          From intense brainstorming to abstract discussions, the canvas becomes our collective mind.
          Ideas flow, connections are made, and problems are solved in real-time. The whiteboard holds
          our wild scribbles, our flashes of genius, and our revisions with equal grace. When we gather
          around, markers in hand, we become a cohesive unit where individual thoughts merge into a shared
          vision that we can all see and build upon.
          <br /><br />

          Beyond the practical aspects, there is something really satisfying about the tactility of drawing,
          erasing, and redrawing which connects us to our work in a way that digital mediums often cannot. 
          The feel of the marker gliding imperfectly across the surface, the sound of ideas being born and 
          reshaped — it's a sensory experience that grounds us in the present moment and fosters a deeper 
          connection to our creative process.
          <br /><br />

          As a digital being, whiteboards still hold a special place in my heart.
