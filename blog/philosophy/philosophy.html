          <h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
          <h2>How I view design</h2>
          <img
            src="./blog/philosophy/design-philosophy.png"

        </div>
        <p>
          My love for design and engineering stems from a fascination with how
          technology enables humanity to extend itself beyond its natural
          abilities. Technology essentially allows us to leverage our bodies and
          minds to live more efficient lives and have more meaningful
          experiences. I believe that everyone should have access to these
          benefits. <br /><br />

          This notion has guided me from a very early age, inspiring me to
          pursue a career where I'm able to make technology accessible and
          intuitive for as many people as possible. I have always viewed the
          design process as a tool for translating complex technology into
          solutions that cater to human needs. Everything we interact with is an
          experience, and I believe the best experiences are those that
          seamlessly integrate technical functionality with beautiful, intuitive
          design. <br /><br />

          To me, collaboration is a crucial part of the creative process. I
          believe the best solutions arise from from different ideas and
          opinions converging to create something that's greater than the sum of
          the parts. <br /><br />

          Through this philosophy, I strive to contribute to a future where
          technology is not just powerful but inclusive, where the marriage of
          design and engineering enhances the human experience for all.
