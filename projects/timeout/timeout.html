          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>
            The modern digital era has created many opportunities for people to get lost in digital experiences. Wether it is focused work, gaming or media consumption, these activities all pose challenges to maintaining a healthy screen time as individuals tend to lose track of time, neglect breaks, and compromise physical and social well-being.
          </p>
          
          <img class="r"
          src="projects/timeout/img/working.jpeg"
          alt="Woman in dreads and black hoodie sitting at a desk, working in a video editing program on a desktop computer"
        />
        <p>
          Current tools designed to limit screen time only allow users to set time limits. These time limits are defined in terms of total app or system usage during a day, but don't account for whether the user is spending long consecutive periods at a time without breaks. Apple's Screen Time also resets at midnight, making it easy to unintentionally spend more time than intended around this hour.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          The "Time to Stand" feature on Apple Watch is generally a good solution as it intelligently reminds the wearer to stand up and move around every hour - which indirectly encourages taking a break. However, this feature currenly requires an Apple Watch and it doesn't take into account what the user is doing.

        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <h5>Wireflow</h5>
        A wireflow was made in Figma to quickly visualize the different steps and prototype what the available user actions would be in each step.

          src="projects/timeout/img/Wireflow.png"
          alt="Three steps showing 1. A desktop layout 2. A prompt to take a break 3. A timer counting down"
        />
        <h5>Interactive prototype</h5>
        <p>
          A high-fidelity interactive prototype was made in Figma using assets from Apple's Design Library. The goal was to get a sense of how the feature would look and feel if Apple would implement it.

        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Using the prototype led to a few realizations:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>It's jarring to have the "Time for a Break" suddenly take over the whole screen</li>
            <li>It feels redundant to require a confirmation of starting the break</li>
            <li>Encouraging the user to move, breathe and hydrate is unnecessary</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer-2"></div>
        <h5>Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          From the insights gathered by the interactive prototype, new iterations were created with a focus on refining the flow and UI:

        <h6>Preferences</h6>
        <p>TimeOut can be customized according to individual needs in the Screen Time section in System Preferences. Users can adjust the frequency and duration of breaks, choose wether to allow for snoozing or if the break timer automatically resets on inactivity. </p>

            />
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h5>Considerations</h5>
        <p>Beyond the visual design of TimeOut, the system should also take into account whether the user is doing something that should not be interrupted. This includes activities like:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Having a phone call</li>
          <li>Using navigation</li>
          <li>Using camera</li>
          <li>Recording</li>
          <li>Exercising</li>
          <li>In gameplay</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To ensure that TimeOut doesn't interrupt these kinds of activities, the operating system should check if the microphone, camera or gyroscope (on mobile devices) is being used. Also, application type can be used to determine weather it's a good or bad time to suggest a break.  
          <br><br>
          Furthermore, applications could be given access to a TimeOut API that enables developers the possibility to prevent TimeOut from being invoked during specific parts of an app experience.
