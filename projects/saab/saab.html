          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Researched and developed a foundation to a design system for complex
            Airborne Radar Applications. <br />
            <br />
            Carried out multiple <strong>Ethnographic Studies</strong> and
            <strong>Co-design Workshops</strong> with developers, designers and
            end-users to gather requirements from different perspectives.
            Analyzed the current product portfolio through
            <strong>Interface Audits</strong>, mapped out inconsistencies and
            performed <strong>Heuristic Evaluations</strong> on the current UIs
            to identify usability and accessibility issues. Performed
            <strong>Literature Studies</strong> on how to bring coherence to UIs
            and read three books on best practices for building and managing
            effective design systems within large organizations. Finally,
            presented insights and ideas to decision makers across the company
            and prototyped a first iteration using
            <strong>Tokenized Components in Figma</strong>. This was followed by
            implementing parts of the system and providing to developers using
            components in <strong>Java Swing</strong>.

          <p>
            GlobalEye is the world's most advanced Airborne Early Warning &
            Control (AEW&C) system. It provides long-range detection and
            identification of objects in air, at sea and over land by combining
            a variety of advanced sensors with a suite of sophisticated
            applications.

          <h5>AEW&C Applications</h5>
          <p>
            Aboard the aircraft, operators use two applications, A1 and A2, for
            controlling and interpreting real-time data from the sensors. Data
            is transmitted via satellite to a third, ground-based application:
            A3.

            <h5>Problem brief</h5>
            <p>
              The AEW&C applications have been developed by different teams in
              different locations without a synchronized design language. As a
              result, the UIs differ in visual style, interaction patterns and
              how tasks are performed, while also diverging from the Saab brand.
              <br />
              <br />
              This leads to <b>incoherence</b> and <b>usability issues</b> for
              radar operators and
              <b>impedes collaboration and resource sharing</b> in development.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Project Proposal</h5>
            <p>
              To address these problems, the Human Factors Integration team at
              Saab posited that we might be able to design a
              <b>unified interface</b>
              to be used as a common base for increasing functional and visual
              consistency across the application suite.

                The applications have different UIs partly because they have

            <b>In essence:</b> <br />
            A design system is a collection of reusable, coherent components and
            patterns built on fundamental rules and attributes which can be
            combined to build interfaces in an efficient, scalable and coherent
            manner.

            <br />
            Essentially, it functions as a platform - a common source of truth -
            that facilitates collaboration, communication and knowledge sharing
